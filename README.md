## 🧩 How to Use

1. **Open** above website or download and open `png2svg.html` in your browser.  
2. **Upload** any image file (`.png`, `.jpg`, `.webp`, `.svg`, etc.)

4. Click **“Make SVG”** 🪄  
5. Preview both the image and generated SVG.  
6. Use any of these options:

## 🧠 How It Works

The script:
- Reads the uploaded image as a base64 **Data URL**
- Wraps it inside an `<svg>` element using the specified width and height
- Exports the result as text or downloadable file

No data ever leaves your browser 🌐
